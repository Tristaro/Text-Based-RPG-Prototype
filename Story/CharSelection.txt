the figure intoned, 
[FIGURE_START
Your choices sculpt the tapestry of destiny itself...
The dice have marked your path, yet your role remains unclaimed.

Intrigued, I sought guidance... 
[MY_START
What roles await within this intricate dance of Fate?
[MY_END]
The figure's eyes gleamed with ancient knowledge... 
[FIGURE_START
Four paths lay before you, each embodying a facet of destiny's design...
A Barbarian, wielding raw strength and unyielding will; 
A Paladin, a paragon of honor and righteousness; 
A Bard, weaving tales and melodies that shape reality; 
An Astrologer, attuned to cosmic forces and wielding the power of the stars.‚Äù

Sensing my uncertainty, the figure continued...

Choose wisely, for within these roles lie the threads of your journey...
The dice have spoken, 
but it is you who must embrace the role they've unveiled.

I inquired, seeking clarity amid the enigmatic possibilities.
The figure's gaze softened with understanding...

Your path is yours to define... 
Listen to the echoes within, and let the echoes of the dice guide your intuition.

With a nod of gratitude, 
I turned to the ancient stone table, 
the dice resting quietly upon its surface... 
The figures surrounding me observed in silence, 
their masked faces holding a quiet anticipation as I reached for the dice once more,
ready to embrace the role foretold by Fate.
