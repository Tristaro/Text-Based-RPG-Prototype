The echoes of villages aflame and innocent lives lost linger in the air as you grasp the dice, 
your determination etched upon them. 
With a fervent resolve, 
you cast the dice once more upon the ancient stone table. 
A blinding light engulfs your senses, 
and the world fades into obscurity.

In the midst of the blinding brilliance, 
a sense of serenity washes over you. 
As consciousness returns, 
you find yourself within the hallowed halls of a sanctuary, 
the embodiment of honor and virtue. 
The dice, 
your faithful companions, 
rest within your grip.

Surrounded by the sanctity of the Paladin's stronghold, 
you stand, 
armor gleaming in the soft luminescence. 
The echoes of prayers and vows resonate through the corridors, 
a testament to your unwavering dedication.

The dice hum with a divine energy, 
pulsating in rhythm with your heartbeat. 
Your tutorial beginsâ€”an initiation into the sacred arts, 
an exploration of your Paladin's virtues, 
guided by the dice, 
shaping your destiny.
