As the echoes of battle fade into the depths of memory, 
a surge of exhaustion overtakes you. 
The weight of past and present blurs, 
and with a final act of resolve, 
you toss the dice once more unto the ancient stone table. 
Darkness encroaches, and consciousness slips away.

Amidst the shadows of slumber, 
a distant thunder rouses you. 
Blinking away the haze, 
you find yourself amidst the untamed wilds, 
the scent of earth and moss mingling with the sharp tang of battle in the air.
In your hand, 
the dice—the same pair that guided your fate moments before.

With a primal instinct, 
you rise, 
feeling the earth resonate beneath your feet. 
The terrain familiarizes itself with your presence, 
as if acknowledging your return. 
Around you, 
the dense forests and rugged terrain of your homeland stretch endlessly.
The dice, 
now firmly clutched in your grasp, 
resonate with a pulsating energy, 
a manifestation of the raw power coursing through you. 
Your tutorial begins—a journey through the wilds, 
an initiation into your prowess as the Barbarian, 
guided by the dice, 
shaping your destiny.
